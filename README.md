This is a simple Python script I created as part of my ChiPy Mentor program for 2015.

It basically will parse the first 512 bytes of an image (or if you just export out the first sector, just that), and read
the partition data from whatever partitions are there.

Special thanks to Paul Embreo for being my Mentor and helping with this.
